# Profit and Loss Aptitude Quiz

### **Question 1**

A shopkeeper sells an item for ₹492 after offering an 18% discount on the marked price. He makes a 23% profit. What would have been his profit percentage if he had not offered any discount?

1.  50%
2.  41%
3.  45%
4.  55%

**Correct Answer:** 1. 50%

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Find the Cost Price (CP):** The item was sold for ₹492, which includes a 23% profit.
    - Selling Price (SP) = $CP \times (1 + \frac{Profit\%}{100})$
    - $₹492 = CP \times 1.23$
    - $CP = \frac{₹492}{1.23} = ₹400$
2.  **Find the Marked Price (MP):** The selling price of ₹492 was reached after an 18% discount on the marked price.
    - $SP = MP \times (1 - \frac{Discount\%}{100})$
    - $₹492 = MP \times 0.82$
    - $MP = \frac{₹492}{0.82} = ₹600$
3.  **Calculate Profit without Discount:** If no discount was given, the item would be sold at the Marked Price (₹600).
    - New Profit = $₹600 - ₹400 = ₹200$
4.  **Calculate New Profit Percentage:**
    - Profit % = $(\frac{New Profit}{CP}) \times 100 = (\frac{₹200}{₹400}) \times 100 = 50\%$

### **Question 2**

A dishonest dealer professes to sell his goods at cost price but uses a weight of 960 grams for a 1 kg weight. Find his gain percent.

1.  4.17%
2.  4%
3.  5%
4.  4.5%

**Correct Answer:** 1. 4.17%

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Identify the Gain:** The dealer's gain is the amount of goods he saves by using a false weight.
    - Error = $1000 \text{g} - 960 \text{g} = 40 \text{g}$
2.  **Calculate Gain Percentage:** The profit is the 40 grams he saves on the actual amount of goods he sells (960 grams).
    - Gain % = $(\frac{\text{Error}}{\text{Actual Weight Sold}}) \times 100$
    - Gain % = $(\frac{40}{960}) \times 100 = \frac{1}{24} \times 100 = 4.166...\% \approx 4.17\%$

### **Question 3**

If the cost price of 12 pens is equal to the selling price of 8 pens, the gain percent is:

1.  50%
2.  25%
3.  33.33%
4.  66.66%

**Correct Answer:** 1. 50%

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Set up the Equation:** Let CP be the cost price of one pen and SP be the selling price of one pen.
    - $12 \times CP = 8 \times SP$
2.  **Find the SP/CP Ratio:**
    - $\frac{SP}{CP} = \frac{12}{8} = \frac{3}{2}$
3.  **Calculate Gain Percentage:** The ratio shows that for a cost of 2 units, the selling price is 3 units, so the profit is 1 unit.
    - Profit % = $(\frac{\text{Profit}}{CP}) \times 100 = (\frac{1}{2}) \times 100 = 50\%$

### **Question 4**

A man bought two goats for ₹1008. He sold one at a loss of 20% and the other at a profit of 44%. If each goat was sold for the same price, the cost price of the goat which was sold at a loss was:

1.  ₹648
2.  ₹360
3.  ₹504
4.  ₹400

**Correct Answer:** 1. ₹648

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Define Variables:** Let the cost prices be $C_1$ and $C_2$.
    - $C_1 + C_2 = ₹1008$
2.  **Equate Selling Prices:**
    - Goat 1 (20% loss): SP = $C_1 \times 0.80$
    - Goat 2 (44% profit): SP = $C_2 \times 1.44$
    - $0.80 \times C_1 = 1.44 \times C_2 \implies C_1 = 1.8 \times C_2$
3.  **Solve the Equations:** Substitute the second equation into the first.
    - $(1.8 \times C_2) + C_2 = ₹1008$
    - $2.8 \times C_2 = ₹1008 \implies C_2 = ₹360$
4.  **Find C1:** The goat sold at a loss is $C_1$.
    - $C_1 = ₹1008 - C_2 = ₹1008 - ₹360 = ₹648$

### **Question 5**

A trader marks his goods at 20% above the cost price. He sells them at a discount of 10%. What is his net profit percentage?

1.  8%
2.  10%
3.  12%
4.  2%

**Correct Answer:** 1. 8%

**Solution Explanation:**
Use the successive percentage change formula: $Net\% = x + y + \frac{xy}{100}$
-   Let $x = +20$ (markup) and $y = -10$ (discount).
-   $Net\% = 20 - 10 + \frac{(20)(-10)}{100} = 10 - 2 = 8\%$
-   A positive result indicates a net profit of 8%.

### **Question 6**

By selling an article for ₹72, there is a loss of 10%. In order to gain 5%, at what price should it be sold?

1.  ₹84
2.  ₹80
3.  ₹87
4.  ₹90

**Correct Answer:** 1. ₹84

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Find the Cost Price (CP):** A 10% loss means ₹72 is 90% of the CP.
    - $CP \times 0.90 = ₹72$
    - $CP = \frac{₹72}{0.90} = ₹80$
2.  **Calculate New Selling Price (SP):** For a 5% gain on a CP of ₹80.
    - New SP = $₹80 \times (1 + 0.05) = ₹80 \times 1.05 = ₹84$

### **Question 7**

A shopkeeper bought 80 kg of sugar at ₹13.50/kg. He mixed it with 120 kg of sugar costing ₹16/kg. To make a 20% profit, he must sell the mixture at:

1.  ₹18 per kg
2.  ₹15 per kg
3.  ₹17.40 per kg
4.  ₹16.20 per kg

**Correct Answer:** 1. ₹18 per kg

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Calculate Total Cost:**
    - Cost 1 = $80 \times ₹13.50 = ₹1080$
    - Cost 2 = $120 \times ₹16.00 = ₹1920$
    - Total Cost = $₹1080 + ₹1920 = ₹3000$
2.  **Calculate Average Cost per kg:**
    - Total Quantity = $80 + 120 = 200 \text{ kg}$
    - Average Cost = $\frac{₹3000}{200 \text{ kg}} = ₹15/\text{kg}$
3.  **Calculate Selling Price per kg:** For a 20% profit.
    - SP/kg = $₹15 \times 1.20 = ₹18/\text{kg}$

***

### **Question 8**

The percentage profit earned by selling an article for ₹1920 is equal to the percentage loss incurred by selling the same article for ₹1280. At what price should the article be sold to make a 25% profit?

1.  ₹2000
2.  ₹1600
3.  ₹1800
4.  ₹2200

**Correct Answer:** 1. ₹2000

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Find the Cost Price (CP):** When profit % equals loss %, the CP is the average of the two selling prices.
    - $CP = \frac{₹1920 + ₹1280}{2} = \frac{₹3200}{2} = ₹1600$
2.  **Calculate New Selling Price:** For a 25% profit on a CP of ₹1600.
    - New SP = $₹1600 \times 1.25 = ₹2000$

### **Question 9**

A reduction of 20% in the price of wheat enables a person to buy 5 kg more for ₹1200. What is the original price of wheat per kg?

1.  ₹60
2.  ₹48
3.  ₹50
4.  ₹72

**Correct Answer:** 1. ₹60

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Calculate Money Saved:**
    - Saving = $20\%$ of $₹1200 = 0.20 \times ₹1200 = ₹240$
2.  **Find the New Price:** This saving allows the purchase of the extra 5 kg.
    - New Price/kg = $\frac{₹240}{5 \text{ kg}} = ₹48/\text{kg}$
3.  **Find the Original Price:** The new price (₹48) is 80% of the original price.
    - Original Price $\times 0.80 = ₹48$
    - Original Price = $\frac{₹48}{0.80} = ₹60/\text{kg}$

### **Question 10**

A shopkeeper cheats to the extent of 10% while buying as well as selling, by using false weights. His total gain is:

1.  22.22%
2.  20%
3.  21%
4.  25%

**Correct Answer:** 1. 22.22%

**Solution Explanation:**
-   **While buying**, he gets 1100g for the price of 1000g.
-   **While selling**, he gives 900g for the price of 1000g.
-   Effectively, his cost is for 900g, but his revenue is from 1100g (by chaining the two transactions). The goods he sells for profit are the 200g difference (1100g - 900g).
-   His profit is calculated on what he actually gives away (the cost basis).
-   Gain % = $(\frac{\text{Goods Gained}}{\text{Goods Sold}}) \times 100 = (\frac{1100-900}{900}) \times 100$
-   Gain % = $(\frac{200}{900}) \times 100 = \frac{2}{9} \times 100 = 22.22\%$
