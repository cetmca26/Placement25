# Aptitude Questions: Profit & Loss

## User-Provided Questions

### **Question 1**
When an article is sold for Rs. 21.12, there is a loss of 4%. What is the cost price of the article?
1.  Rs. 20.27
2.  Rs. 21.90
3.  Rs. 22.00
4.  Rs. 20.00

---
**Answer:** 3. Rs. 22.00

**Solution Explanation:**
A loss of 4% means the selling price (SP) is 96% of the cost price (CP).
* **Formula:** $SP = CP \times (1 - \frac{Loss\%}{100})$
* $21.12 = CP \times (1 - \frac{4}{100})$
* $21.12 = CP \times 0.96$
* $CP = \frac{21.12}{0.96} = 22$

**ðŸ’¡ Quick Tip:** To divide by 0.96, you can multiply the numerator and denominator by 100 to get $\frac{2112}{96}$, which is easier to simplify.

### **Question 2**
If books bought at prices ranging from Rs. 200 to Rs. 325 are sold at prices ranging from Rs. 300 to Rs. 450, what is the greatest possible profit that can be made in selling eight books?
1.  Rs. 2000
2.  Rs. 1600
3.  Rs. 1200
4.  Cannot be determined

---
**Answer:** 1. Rs. 2000

**Solution Explanation:**
To achieve the **greatest possible profit**, you must have the **lowest possible cost price (CP)** and the **highest possible selling price (SP)**.
* Lowest CP from the range = Rs. 200
* Highest SP from the range = Rs. 450
* Greatest profit per book = Highest SP - Lowest CP = $450 - 200 = \text{Rs. } 250$
* Greatest profit for 8 books = $250 \times 8 = \text{Rs. } 2000$

### **Question 3**
A fruitseller sells mangoes at the rate of Rs. 8 per kg and thereby loses 25%. At what price per kg should he have sold them to make a profit of 25%?
1.  Rs. 12.00
2.  Rs. 13.33
3.  Rs. 14.50
4.  Rs. 10.67

---
**Answer:** 2. Rs. 13.33

**Solution Explanation:**
First, find the cost price (CP) using the initial selling price (SP) and loss.
* **Step 1: Find CP**
    * A 25% loss means the SP (Rs. 8) is 75% of the CP.
    * $8 = CP \times 0.75 \implies CP = \frac{8}{0.75} = \frac{8}{3/4} = \frac{32}{3}$
* **Step 2: Find the new SP for a 25% profit**
    * New SP = $CP \times (1 + \frac{Profit\%}{100})$
    * New SP = $\frac{32}{3} \times 1.25 = \frac{32}{3} \times \frac{5}{4} = \frac{8 \times 5}{3} = \frac{40}{3} = 13.33$

### **Question 4**
A shopkeeper sold walnut at the rate of Rs. 1,190 per kg and bears a loss of 10%. Now if he decides to sell it at Rs. 1249.5 per kg, what will be the result?
1.  11% loss
2.  5.5% loss
3.  5.5% gain
4.  11% gain

---
**Answer:** 2. 5.5% loss

**Solution Explanation:**
* **Step 1: Find the Cost Price (CP)**
    * SP1 = Rs. 1190, which is 90% of the CP due to a 10% loss.
    * $1190 = CP \times 0.90 \implies CP = \frac{1190}{0.9} = \frac{11900}{9} \approx 1322.22$
* **Step 2: Calculate Profit/Loss with the new SP**
    * New SP2 = Rs. 1249.5
    * Loss = CP - SP2 = $\frac{11900}{9} - 1249.5 = \frac{11900 - 11245.5}{9} = \frac{654.5}{9}$
* **Step 3: Calculate Loss Percentage**
    * Loss % = $(\frac{\text{Loss}}{CP}) \times 100 = (\frac{654.5/9}{11900/9}) \times 100 = \frac{654.5}{11900} \times 100 = 5.5\%$

### **Question 5**
A shopkeeper sold cocoa seeds at the rate of Rs. 1230 a kg and bears a loss of 5%. Now if he decides to sell it at Rs. 1353 per kg, what will be the result?
1.  4.5% gain
2.  9% gain
3.  4.5% loss
4.  9% loss

---
**Answer:** 1. 4.5% gain

**Solution Explanation:**
* **Step 1: Find the Cost Price (CP)**
    * SP1 = Rs. 1230, which is 95% of the CP.
    * $1230 = CP \times 0.95 \implies CP = \frac{1230}{0.95} \approx 1294.74$
* **Step 2: Calculate Profit/Loss with the new SP**
    * New SP2 = Rs. 1353
    * Profit = SP2 - CP = $1353 - 1294.74 = 58.26$
* **Step 3: Calculate Profit Percentage**
    * Profit % = $(\frac{\text{Profit}}{CP}) \times 100 = \frac{58.26}{1294.74} \times 100 \approx 4.5\%$

**ðŸ’¡ Quick Tip:** A faster way is to use ratios: $\frac{\text{New SP}}{\text{Old SP}} = \frac{1353}{1230} = 1.1$. This means the new price is 110% of the old price. Since the old price was 95% of the cost, the new price is $1.10 \times 95\% = 104.5\%$ of the cost. This represents a **4.5% gain**.

### **Question 6**
If the selling price of an article is 5/4 of its cost price, then the profit percentage in the transaction is?
1.  16%
2.  20%
3.  24%
4.  25%

---
**Answer:** 4. 25%

**Solution Explanation:**
* Given: $SP = \frac{5}{4} \times CP$
* Profit = $SP - CP = (\frac{5}{4} \times CP) - CP = (\frac{5}{4} - 1) \times CP = \frac{1}{4} \times CP$
* Profit % = $(\frac{\text{Profit}}{CP}) \times 100 = (\frac{\frac{1}{4} \times CP}{CP}) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%$

***

### **Question 7**
The ratio of cost price and selling price is 4:5. The profit percentage is?
1.  20%
2.  25%
3.  30%
4.  15%

---
**Answer:** 2. 25%

**Solution Explanation:**
* Let the Cost Price (CP) = 4x and the Selling Price (SP) = 5x.
* Profit = SP - CP = $5x - 4x = x$
* Profit % = $(\frac{\text{Profit}}{CP}) \times 100 = \frac{x}{4x} \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%$

***

### **Question 8**
The profit earned by selling an article for Rs. 900 is double the loss incurred when the same article is sold for Rs. 450. At what price should the article be sold to make a 25% profit?
1.  Rs. 600
2.  Rs. 800
3.  Rs. 750
4.  Rs. 700

---
**Answer:** 3. Rs. 750

**Solution Explanation:**
* **Step 1: Formulate the equation**
    * Let the Cost Price be CP.
    * Profit at Rs. 900 is $(900 - CP)$.
    * Loss at Rs. 450 is $(CP - 450)$.
    * Given: $(900 - CP) = 2 \times (CP - 450)$
* **Step 2: Solve for CP**
    * $900 - CP = 2CP - 900$
    * $1800 = 3CP$
    * $CP = \text{Rs. } 600$
* **Step 3: Calculate the new SP**
    * New SP for 25% profit = $600 \times 1.25 = 600 \times \frac{5}{4} = \text{Rs. } 750$

***

### **Question 9**
The cost price of 50 articles is equal to the selling price of 40 articles. The gain percentage is?
1.  20%
2.  25%
3.  30%
4.  40%

---
**Answer:** 2. 25%

**Solution Explanation:**
* Let CP be the cost price of one article and SP be the selling price of one article.
* Given: $50 \times CP = 40 \times SP$
* Rearrange to find the ratio of SP to CP: $\frac{SP}{CP} = \frac{50}{40} = \frac{5}{4}$
* This means for a cost of 4 units, the selling price is 5 units. The profit is 1 unit.
* Profit % = $(\frac{\text{Profit}}{CP}) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%$

***

### **Question 10**
A man gains 20% by selling an article for a certain price. If he sells it at double the price, the percentage of profit will be?
1.  100%
2.  120%
3.  140%
4.  160%

---
**Answer:** 3. 140%

**Solution Explanation:**
* Let the Cost Price (CP) = 100.
* A 20% gain means the initial Selling Price (SP1) = $100 \times 1.20 = 120$.
* He now sells it at double the price. New Selling Price (SP2) = $2 \times SP1 = 2 \times 120 = 240$.
* New Profit = SP2 - CP = $240 - 100 = 140$.
* New Profit % = $(\frac{\text{New Profit}}{CP}) \times 100 = \frac{140}{100} \times 100 = 140\%$

## Additional Questions

### **Question 11**
A dealer buys a watch for Rs. 800 and gets a discount of 10%. He then spends Rs. 20 on its packaging and sells it for Rs. 876. What is his profit percentage?
1.  15%
2.  18%
3.  20%
4.  25%

---
**Answer:** 2. 18%

**Solution Explanation:**
* Price after discount = $800 - (10\% \text{ of } 800) = 800 - 80 = \text{Rs. } 720$.
* Cost of packaging = Rs. 20.
* Total Cost Price (CP) = $720 + 20 = \text{Rs. } 740$.
* Selling Price (SP) = Rs. 876.
* Profit = $876 - 740 = \text{Rs. } 136$.
* Profit % = $(\frac{136}{740}) \times 100 = 18.37\% \approx 18\%$ (assuming nearest integer).

### **Question 12**
If a man were to sell his chair for Rs. 720, he would lose 25%. To gain 25%, he should sell it for:
1.  Rs. 1200
2.  Rs. 1000
3.  Rs. 960
4.  Rs. 900

---
**Answer:** 1. Rs. 1200

**Solution Explanation:**
* Rs. 720 represents 75% of the Cost Price (CP) because of the 25% loss.
* CP = $\frac{720}{0.75} = \text{Rs. } 960$.
* To gain 25%, the new SP = $CP \times 1.25 = 960 \times 1.25 = \text{Rs. } 1200$.

***

### **Question 13**
A dishonest dealer uses a scale of 90 cm instead of a meter scale and claims to sell at cost price. What is his profit percent?
1.  9%
2.  10%
3.  11.11%
4.  12.5%

---
**Answer:** 3. 11.11%

**Solution Explanation:**
* The dealer sells 90 cm but charges for 100 cm.
* Profit = Goods saved = $100 - 90 = 10 \text{ cm}$.
* The profit is calculated on the amount of goods actually sold.
* Profit % = $(\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Actual Goods Sold}}) \times 100 = \frac{10}{90} \times 100 = \frac{1}{9} \times 100 = 11.11\%$

### **Question 14**
By selling 33 meters of cloth, a merchant gains the selling price of 11 meters. Find the gain percent.
1.  25%
2.  33.33%
3.  50%
4.  40%

---
**Answer:** 3. 50%

**Solution Explanation:**
* **Formula:** Profit = SP - CP.
* Given: Profit on 33m = SP of 11m.
* So, (SP of 33m) - (CP of 33m) = SP of 11m.
* Rearranging gives: (SP of 22m) = (CP of 33m).
* Let the CP of 1m be Re. 1. Then CP of 33m = Rs. 33. This is equal to the SP of 22m.
* So, for an investment of Rs. 22 (CP of 22m), the return is Rs. 33 (SP of 22m).
* Profit = $33 - 22 = 11$.
* Profit % = $(\frac{11}{22}) \times 100 = 50\%$.

### **Question 15**
A trader marks his goods at 40% above the cost price but allows a discount of 25%. What is his gain or loss percent?
1.  15% gain
2.  10% gain
3.  5% gain
4.  10% loss

---
**Answer:** 3. 5% gain

**Solution Explanation:**
* Let the Cost Price (CP) = 100.
* Marked Price (MP) = $100 + (40\% \text{ of } 100) = 140$.
* Discount = $25\%$ of $140 = 0.25 \times 140 = 35$.
* Selling Price (SP) = MP - Discount = $140 - 35 = 105$.
* Since the SP (105) is greater than the CP (100), there is a gain.
* Gain % = $\frac{105-100}{100} \times 100 = 5\%$.

### **Question 16**
A man buys 12 articles for Rs. 12 and sells them at the rate of Rs. 1.25 per article. His gain percentage is:
1.  20%
2.  25%
3.  15%
4.  18%

---
**Answer:** 2. 25%

**Solution Explanation:**
* CP of 12 articles = Rs. 12, so CP of 1 article = Re. 1.
* SP of 1 article = Rs. 1.25.
* Profit per article = $1.25 - 1 = 0.25$.
* Profit % = $(\frac{0.25}{1}) \times 100 = 25\%$.

***

### **Question 17**
The cost price of an article is 80% of its marked price for sale. How much percent does the tradesman gain after allowing a discount of 12%?
1.  20%
2.  12%
3.  10%
4.  8%

---
**Answer:** 3. 10%

**Solution Explanation:**
* Let the Marked Price (MP) = 100.
* Cost Price (CP) = $80\%$ of MP = 80.
* Discount = $12\%$ of MP = 12.
* Selling Price (SP) = MP - Discount = $100 - 12 = 88$.
* Profit = SP - CP = $88 - 80 = 8$.
* Profit % = $(\frac{\text{Profit}}{CP}) \times 100 = \frac{8}{80} \times 100 = 10\%$.

### **Question 18**
A shopkeeper sells two watches for Rs. 308 each. On one, he gets a 12% profit and on the other, he gets a 12% loss. His profit or loss in the entire transaction was:
1.  No profit, no loss
2.  1% loss
3.  1.44% loss
4.  1.44% profit

---
**Answer:** 3. 1.44% loss

**Solution Explanation:**
**ðŸ’¡ Quick Tip:** When two items are sold at the same selling price, one at a profit of x% and the other at a loss of x%, there is always an overall loss.
* **Formula for Overall Loss %:** $(\frac{x}{10})^2 \% = (\frac{12}{10})^2 \% = (1.2)^2 \% = 1.44\%$.
* So, the overall result is a **1.44% loss**.

***

### **Question 19**
A man sold two articles at Rs. 375 each. On one, he gains 25%, and on the other, he loses 25%. The gain or loss% on the whole transaction is:
1.  6%
2.  4%
3.  6.25%
4.  7.5%

---
**Answer:** 3. 6.25%

**Solution Explanation:**
This follows the same pattern as the previous question. The actual selling price does not matter when calculating the percentage loss.
* **Formula for Overall Loss %:** $(\frac{x}{10})^2 \% = (\frac{25}{10})^2 \% = (2.5)^2 \% = 6.25\%$.
* The overall result is a **6.25% loss**.

***

### **Question 20**
If the loss on an article is 15%, then the ratio of the cost price and selling price will be:
1.  17:20
2.  20:17
3.  17:23
4.  23:17

---
**Answer:** 2. 20:17

**Solution Explanation:**
* Let the Cost Price (CP) = 100.
* A loss of 15% means the Selling Price (SP) = $100 - 15 = 85$.
* The ratio of CP to SP is $100 : 85$.
* Simplifying the ratio by dividing both sides by 5 gives $20 : 17$.
