# Aptitude Quiz: Time, Speed, and Distance

### **Question 1**
A car covers a distance of 720 km at a constant speed. If the speed of the car was 10 km/hr more, it would have taken 1 hour less to cover the same distance. What is the original speed of the car in km/hr?
1.  70 km/hr
2.  80 km/hr
3.  90 km/hr
4.  60 km/hr

---
**Answer:** 2. 80 km/hr

**Solution Explanation:**
Let the original speed be $S$ km/hr and the time taken be $T$ hours.
* **Formula:** Distance = Speed Ã— Time
* From the problem, we have:
    1.  $720 = S \times T$
    2.  $720 = (S + 10) \times (T - 1)$

From equation (1), $T = \frac{720}{S}$. Substitute this into equation (2):
* $720 = (S + 10) \times (\frac{720}{S} - 1)$
* $720 = 720 - S + \frac{7200}{S} - 10$
* $0 = -S + \frac{7200}{S} - 10$
* $S + 10 = \frac{7200}{S}$
* $S(S + 10) = 7200 \implies S^2 + 10S - 7200 = 0$
* Factoring the quadratic equation: $(S + 90)(S - 80) = 0$.
* Since speed cannot be negative, $S = 80$ km/hr.

**ðŸ’¡ Quick Tip:** For MCQ, you can test the options. Let's test 80 km/hr.
* Original time = $720 / 80 = 9$ hours.
* New speed = $80 + 10 = 90$ km/hr. New time = $720 / 90 = 8$ hours.
* The difference is $9 - 8 = 1$ hour, which matches the question.

### **Question 2**
A man travels from his home to his office at 30 km/hr and returns at 20 km/hr. If the whole journey took 5 hours, what is the distance from his home to the office?
1.  50 km
2.  60 km
3.  75 km
4.  100 km

---
**Answer:** 2. 60 km

**Solution Explanation:**
When the distance is constant for both parts of a journey, we can use the average speed formula.
* **Formula for Average Speed:** $Avg. Speed = \frac{2 \times S_1 \times S_2}{S_1 + S_2}$
* $Avg. Speed = \frac{2 \times 30 \times 20}{30 + 20} = \frac{1200}{50} = 24$ km/hr.
* Total Distance (to and from office) = Average Speed Ã— Total Time
* Total Distance = $24 \times 5 = 120$ km.
* The question asks for the distance from home to office (one way), which is half of the total distance.
* Distance = $120 / 2 = 60$ km.

***

### **Question 3**
Two trains start at the same time from two stations A and B, 280 km apart, and proceed towards each other. If their speeds are 60 km/hr and 80 km/hr respectively, at what distance from station A will they meet?
1.  100 km
2.  120 km
3.  140 km
4.  160 km

---
**Answer:** 2. 120 km

**Solution Explanation:**
When two objects move towards each other, their speeds add up (relative speed).
* **Formula for Relative Speed (opposite direction):** $S_{rel} = S_1 + S_2$
* Relative Speed = $60 + 80 = 140$ km/hr.
* Time to meet = $\frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{280}{140} = 2$ hours.
* The trains will meet after 2 hours. To find the distance from station A, we use the speed of the train starting from A.
* Distance from A = Speed of train from A Ã— Time to meet
* Distance from A = $60 \times 2 = 120$ km.

***

### **Question 4**
A 240-meter long train crosses a 360-meter long platform in 30 seconds. What is the speed of the train in km/hr?
1.  60 km/hr
2.  72 km/hr
3.  54 km/hr
4.  66 km/hr

---
**Answer:** 2. 72 km/hr

**Solution Explanation:**
When a train crosses a platform, the total distance to be covered is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the platform.
* Total Distance = Length of Train + Length of Platform
* Total Distance = $240 + 360 = 600$ meters.
* Time taken = 30 seconds.
* Speed = $\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{600}{30} = 20$ m/s.
* To convert m/s to km/hr, we multiply by $\frac{18}{5}$.
* Speed in km/hr = $20 \times \frac{18}{5} = 4 \times 18 = 72$ km/hr.

### **Question 5**
In a 100m race, A beats B by 10m and C by 13m. In a race of 180m, by what distance will C be ahead of B?
*(Correction: The question implies C is slower than B if A beats C by more. Let's assume the question meant "by what distance will B beat C?")*
1.  5.4 m
2.  6 m
3.  6.2 m
4.  5.8 m

---
**Answer:** 2. 6 m *(Based on the corrected interpretation)*

**Solution Explanation:**
This problem is about ratios of speeds.
* When A runs 100m, B runs $(100 - 10) = 90$m.
* When A runs 100m, C runs $(100 - 13) = 87$m.
* This means in the same amount of time, the ratio of distances covered by B and C is $90 : 87$.
* This is equivalent to the ratio of their speeds. So, for every 90m that B runs, C runs 87m.
* We want to find the distance C covers when B runs 180m.
* When B runs 90m, C runs 87m.
* When B runs 180m (i.e., $90 \times 2$), C will run $87 \times 2 = 174$m.
* In a 180m race, B will beat C by a distance of $180 - 174 = 6$ meters.

### **Question 6**
A boat can travel at 13 km/hr in still water. If the speed of the stream is 4 km/hr, find the time taken by the boat to go 68 km downstream.
1.  4 hours
2.  5 hours
3.  3 hours
4.  7 hours

---
**Answer:** 1. 4 hours

**Solution Explanation:**
* Speed of boat in still water (B) = 13 km/hr.
* Speed of stream (S) = 4 km/hr.
* **Downstream Speed** = Speed of boat + Speed of stream = $B + S$.
* Downstream Speed = $13 + 4 = 17$ km/hr.
* Distance = 68 km.
* Time = $\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{68}{17} = 4$ hours.

***

### **Question 7**
A man walking at the rate of 5 km/hr crosses a bridge in 15 minutes. The length of the bridge (in meters) is:
1.  600
2.  750
3.  1000
4.  1250

---
**Answer:** 4. 1250

**Solution Explanation:**
First, convert all units to be consistent (meters and seconds).
* Speed = 5 km/hr. To convert to m/s, multiply by $\frac{5}{18}$.
* Speed = $5 \times \frac{5}{18} = \frac{25}{18}$ m/s.
* Time = 15 minutes = $15 \times 60 = 900$ seconds.
* Length of the bridge (Distance) = Speed Ã— Time
* Distance = $\frac{25}{18} \times 900 = 25 \times 50 = 1250$ meters.

### **Question 8**
A car travels the first one-third of a certain distance with a speed of 10 km/hr, the next one-third distance with a speed of 20 km/hr and the last one-third distance with a speed of 60 km/hr. The average speed of the car for the whole journey is:
1.  18 km/hr
2.  24 km/hr
3.  30 km/hr
4.  36 km/hr

---
**Answer:** 1. 18 km/hr

**Solution Explanation:**
When the journey is divided into equal distances, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the individual speeds.
* **Formula for 3 equal distances:** $Avg. Speed = \frac{3 \times S_1 \times S_2 \times S_3}{(S_1S_2) + (S_2S_3) + (S_3S_1)}$
* $Avg. Speed = \frac{3 \times 10 \times 20 \times 60}{(10 \times 20) + (20 \times 60) + (60 \times 10)}$
* $Avg. Speed = \frac{36000}{200 + 1200 + 600} = \frac{36000}{2000} = 18$ km/hr.

**ðŸ’¡ Quick Tip:** You can also assume a distance that is a multiple of the speeds. Let the one-third distance be 60 km (LCM of 10, 20, 60).
* Time 1 = $60/10 = 6$ hr.
* Time 2 = $60/20 = 3$ hr.
* Time 3 = $60/60 = 1$ hr.
* Total Distance = $60+60+60 = 180$ km. Total Time = $6+3+1 = 10$ hr.
* Avg. Speed = $180 / 10 = 18$ km/hr.

***

### **Question 9**
If a train runs at 40 km/hr, it reaches its destination late by 11 minutes. But if it runs at 50 km/hr, it is late by 5 minutes only. The correct time for the train to complete its journey is:
1.  13 minutes
2.  15 minutes
3.  19 minutes
4.  21 minutes

---
**Answer:** 3. 19 minutes

**Solution Explanation:**
Let the distance be D and the correct time be T.
* Time = Distance / Speed. Time in hours.
1.  $(\frac{D}{40}) = T + \frac{11}{60}$
2.  $(\frac{D}{50}) = T + \frac{5}{60}$
Subtracting equation (2) from (1):
* $\frac{D}{40} - \frac{D}{50} = \frac{11}{60} - \frac{5}{60}$
* $\frac{5D - 4D}{200} = \frac{6}{60} = \frac{1}{10}$
* $\frac{D}{200} = \frac{1}{10} \implies D = 20$ km.
Now, find the time taken at 40 km/hr:
* Time taken = $20 / 40 = 0.5$ hours = 30 minutes.
* This time (30 minutes) is 11 minutes late.
* Correct Time = 30 minutes - 11 minutes = 19 minutes.

### **Question 10**
A thief is spotted by a policeman from a distance of 100 meters. When the policeman starts the chase, the thief also starts running. If the speed of the thief is 8 km/hr and that of the policeman is 10 km/hr, how far will the thief have run before he is overtaken?
1.  200 m
2.  300 m
3.  400 m
4.  500 m

---
**Answer:** 3. 400 m

**Solution Explanation:**
The policeman catches the thief when the distance covered by the policeman is 100m more than the distance covered by the thief.
* **Relative Speed (same direction):** $S_{rel} = 10 - 8 = 2$ km/hr.
* Time to catch = $\frac{\text{Initial Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{0.1 \text{ km}}{2 \text{ km/hr}} = 0.05$ hours.
* In this time, the thief runs a certain distance.
* Distance run by thief = Speed of thief Ã— Time to catch
* Distance = $8 \text{ km/hr} \times 0.05 \text{ hours} = 0.4$ km.
* Converting to meters: $0.4 \times 1000 = 400$ meters.

***

### **Question 11**
Two trains of equal length are running on parallel lines in the same direction at 46 km/hr and 36 km/hr. The faster train passes the slower train in 36 seconds. The length of each train is:
1.  50 m
2.  72 m
3.  80 m
4.  82 m

---
**Answer:** 1. 50 m

**Solution Explanation:**
When one train passes another, the total distance covered is the sum of their lengths.
* Let the length of each train be L meters. Total distance = $L + L = 2L$.
* Relative Speed (same direction) = $46 - 36 = 10$ km/hr.
* Convert speed to m/s: $10 \times \frac{5}{18} = \frac{50}{18} = \frac{25}{9}$ m/s.
* Time = 36 seconds.
* Distance = Speed Ã— Time
* $2L = \frac{25}{9} \times 36 = 25 \times 4 = 100$ meters.
* $2L = 100 \implies L = 50$ meters.

### **Question 12**
A boat running upstream takes 8 hours 48 minutes to cover a certain distance, while it takes 4 hours to cover the same distance running downstream. What is the ratio between the speed of the boat and speed of the water current respectively?
1.  2 : 1
2.  3 : 2
3.  8 : 3
4.  Cannot be determined

---
**Answer:** 3. 8 : 3

**Solution Explanation:**
Let the boat's speed be B and the stream's speed be S.
* Upstream speed = B - S. Downstream speed = B + S.
* Time upstream = 8 hr 48 min = $8 + \frac{48}{60} = 8 + \frac{4}{5} = \frac{44}{5}$ hours.
* Time downstream = 4 hours.
* Since distance is constant, $D = Speed \times Time$.
* $(B - S) \times \frac{44}{5} = (B + S) \times 4$
* $(B - S) \times 11 = (B + S) \times 5$
* $11B - 11S = 5B + 5S$
* $6B = 16S$
* $\frac{B}{S} = \frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3}$. The ratio is 8 : 3.

### **Question 13**
Excluding stoppages, the speed of a bus is 54 km/hr and including stoppages, it is 45 km/hr. For how many minutes does the bus stop per hour?
1.  9
2.  10
3.  12
4.  20

---
**Answer:** 2. 10

**Solution Explanation:**
* Due to stoppages, the bus covers less distance in an hour.
* Difference in speed = $54 - 45 = 9$ km/hr.
* This means in one hour, the bus covers 9 km less because of the time it was stopped.
* Time taken to cover this 9 km at the original speed is the stoppage time.
* Stoppage time per hour = $\frac{\text{Distance missed}}{\text{Original Speed}} = \frac{9 \text{ km}}{54 \text{ km/hr}} = \frac{1}{6}$ hours.
* Converting to minutes: $\frac{1}{6} \times 60 = 10$ minutes.

### **Question 14**
A cyclist covers a distance of 750 meters in 2 minutes 30 seconds. What is the speed of the cyclist in km/hr?
1.  15 km/hr
2.  18 km/hr
3.  20 km/hr
4.  24 km/hr

---
**Answer:** 2. 18 km/hr

**Solution Explanation:**
* Distance = 750 meters.
* Time = 2 minutes 30 seconds = $120 + 30 = 150$ seconds.
* Speed (m/s) = $\frac{750}{150} = 5$ m/s.
* Speed (km/hr) = $5 \times \frac{18}{5} = 18$ km/hr.

***

### **Question 15**
A train 110 meters long is running with a speed of 60 km/hr. In what time will it pass a man who is running at 6 km/hr in the direction opposite to that of the train?
1.  5 sec
2.  6 sec
3.  7 sec
4.  10 sec

---
**Answer:** 2. 6 sec

**Solution Explanation:**
* The distance to be covered is the length of the train = 110 m.
* Since they are moving in opposite directions, their speeds add up.
* Relative Speed = $60 + 6 = 66$ km/hr.
* Convert speed to m/s: $66 \times \frac{5}{18} = \frac{11 \times 5}{3} = \frac{55}{3}$ m/s.
* Time = $\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{110}{55/3} = 110 \times \frac{3}{55} = 2 \times 3 = 6$ seconds.

***

### **Question 16**
Two men starting from the same place walk at the rate of 5 km/hr and 5.5 km/hr respectively. What time will they take to be 8.5 km apart, if they walk in the same direction?
1.  4 hours 15 mins
2.  8 hours 30 mins
3.  17 hours
4.  19 hours

---
**Answer:** 3. 17 hours

**Solution Explanation:**
* Since they are walking in the same direction, we use their relative speed, which is the difference in their speeds.
* Relative Speed = $5.5 - 5 = 0.5$ km/hr.
* This means the distance between them increases by 0.5 km every hour.
* Time to be 8.5 km apart = $\frac{\text{Distance Apart}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{8.5}{0.5} = 17$ hours.

### **Question 17**
A boat goes 24 km upstream and 28 km downstream in 6 hours. It goes 30 km upstream and 21 km downstream in 6 hours and 30 minutes. The speed of the boat in still water is:
1.  10 km/hr
2.  8 km/hr
3.  6 km/hr
4.  4 km/hr

---
**Answer:** 1. 10 km/hr

**Solution Explanation:**
Let upstream speed be $U$ and downstream speed be $D$.
1.  $\frac{24}{U} + \frac{28}{D} = 6$
2.  $\frac{30}{U} + \frac{21}{D} = 6.5$ (since 6 hr 30 min = 6.5 hr)
This is a system of linear equations. Let $x = 1/U$ and $y = 1/D$.
1.  $24x + 28y = 6$
2.  $30x + 21y = 6.5$
Solving these equations (e.g., by multiplying first eq by 5 and second by 4), we get:
$120x + 140y = 30$
$120x + 84y = 26$
Subtracting the two, $56y = 4 \implies y = 4/56 = 1/14$. So $D = 14$ km/hr.
Substitute $y=1/14$ into $24x + 28y = 6$:
$24x + 28(1/14) = 6 \implies 24x + 2 = 6 \implies 24x = 4 \implies x = 1/6$. So $U = 6$ km/hr.
* **Speed of Boat** = $\frac{D + U}{2} = \frac{14 + 6}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10$ km/hr.

### **Question 18**
Robert is travelling on his cycle and has calculated to reach point A at 2 P.M. if he travels at 10 km/hr. He will reach there at 12 noon if he travels at 15 km/hr. At what speed must he travel to reach A at 1 P.M.?
1.  8 km/hr
2.  11 km/hr
3.  12 km/hr
4.  14 km/hr

---
**Answer:** 3. 12 km/hr

**Solution Explanation:**
Let the distance be D and the time taken at 10 km/hr be t.
* $D = 10 \times t$
* At 15 km/hr, he reaches 2 hours earlier (12 noon instead of 2 PM). So time taken is $t-2$.
* $D = 15 \times (t - 2)$
* Equating both expressions for D: $10t = 15(t-2) \implies 10t = 15t - 30 \implies 5t = 30 \implies t = 6$ hours.
* The distance D = $10 \times 6 = 60$ km.
* He wants to reach at 1 P.M, which is 1 hour earlier than his 2 P.M. schedule. So, the required time is $6 - 1 = 5$ hours.
* Required Speed = $\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{60}{5} = 12$ km/hr.

### **Question 19**
A and B are two stations 390 km apart. A train starts from A at 10 A.M. and travels towards B at 65 km/hr. Another train starts from B at 11 A.M. and travels towards A at 35 km/hr. At what time do they meet?
1.  2:15 P.M.
2.  2:30 P.M.
3.  3:00 P.M.
4.  3:15 P.M.

---
**Answer:** 2. 2:30 P.M.

**Solution Explanation:**
The first train from A travels for 1 hour (from 10 AM to 11 AM) before the second train starts.
* Distance covered by the first train in 1 hour = $65 \times 1 = 65$ km.
* Remaining distance between the trains at 11 A.M. = $390 - 65 = 325$ km.
* Now, both trains are moving towards each other. Their relative speed is the sum of their speeds.
* Relative Speed = $65 + 35 = 100$ km/hr.
* Time to meet = $\frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{325}{100} = 3.25$ hours.
* 3.25 hours = 3 hours and $0.25 \times 60 = 15$ minutes.
* They will meet 3 hours and 15 minutes after 11 A.M.
* Meeting time = 11:00 A.M. + 3 hours 15 minutes = 2:15 P.M.
* Wait, let me recheck the math. `325/100 = 3.25` is correct. `3h 15m` is correct. `11AM + 3h 15m = 2:15PM`. Let me re-check the options and question.
* Let's re-calculate. $10t = 15t - 30$.. $t=6$. Dist 60km. Time to reach at 1PM is 5 hrs. Speed 12km/hr.
* Previous question seems correct.
* For Q19: $390-65=325$. Rel speed 100. Time = 3.25hrs = 3hr 15min. 11AM + 3hr 15min = 2:15 PM. Option a) seems correct. Why is my internal check pointing to b)? Let me double-check the logic. The logic is sound. It might be a typo in the intended answer key. I will stick with the calculated answer.

**Answer:** 1. 2:15 P.M. *(Correction from initial thought)*

### **Question 20**
Two runners cover the same distance at the rate of 15 km/hr and 16 km/hr respectively. Find the distance travelled when one takes 16 minutes longer than the other.
1.  52 km
2.  58 km
3.  64 km
4.  72 km

---
**Answer:** 3. 64 km

**Solution Explanation:**
Let the distance be D.
* Time taken by first runner ($T_1$) = $D/15$.
* Time taken by second runner ($T_2$) = $D/16$.
* The slower runner (15 km/hr) will take longer.
* The difference in time is 16 minutes = $16/60 = 4/15$ hours.
* $T_1 - T_2 = \frac{4}{15}$
* $\frac{D}{15} - \frac{D}{16} = \frac{4}{15}$
* $\frac{16D - 15D}{15 \times 16} = \frac{4}{15}$
* $\frac{D}{240} = \frac{4}{15}$
* $D = \frac{4 \times 240}{15} = 4 \times 16 = 64$ km.
