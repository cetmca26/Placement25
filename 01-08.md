## Core Questions

### **Question 1**

A man's salary is increased by 10%. If his new salary is ₹1,54,000, what was his original salary?

1.  ₹1,40,000
2.  ₹1,38,600
3.  ₹1,69,400
4.  ₹1,50,000

**Correct Answer:** 1. ₹1,40,000

**Solution Explanation:**
Let the original salary be $x$. A 10% increase means the new salary is 110% of the original salary.
-   New Salary = $x \times (1 + \frac{10}{100}) = 1.10x$
-   $₹1,54,000 = 1.10x$
-   $x = \frac{₹1,54,000}{1.10} = ₹1,40,000$

### **Question 2**

A shopkeeper sells a laptop for ₹60,000, making a profit of 20%. What was the cost price of the laptop?

1.  ₹50,000
2.  ₹48,000
3.  ₹72,000
4.  ₹54,000

**Correct Answer:** 1. ₹50,000

**Solution Explanation:**
The selling price (SP) is the cost price (CP) plus the 20% profit on the CP. So, the SP is 120% of the CP.
-   $SP = CP \times (1 + \frac{20}{100}) = 1.20 \times CP$
-   $₹60,000 = 1.20 \times CP$
-   $CP = \frac{₹60,000}{1.20} = ₹50,000$

### **Question 3**

In an election between two candidates, one candidate got 55% of the total valid votes. 20% of the votes were invalid. If the total number of votes was 7500, what is the number of valid votes that the other candidate got?

1.  2700
2.  2900
3.  3100
4.  3300

**Correct Answer:** 1. 2700

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Total Valid Votes:** Since 20% were invalid, 80% were valid.
    -   Valid Votes = $80\%$ of $7500 = 0.80 \times 7500 = 6000$
2.  **Other Candidate's Share:** If the winner got 55%, the other candidate got $100\% - 55\% = 45\%$ of the valid votes.
3.  **Number of Votes:**
    -   Votes for other candidate = $45\%$ of $6000 = 0.45 \times 6000 = 2700$

### **Question 4**

A student has to obtain 33% of the total marks to pass. He got 125 marks and failed by 40 marks. What are the maximum marks?

1.  500
2.  400
3.  600
4.  300

**Correct Answer:** 1. 500

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Find Passing Marks:** The student failed by 40 marks, so the passing mark is what he got plus 40.
    -   Passing Marks = $125 + 40 = 165$
2.  **Find Maximum Marks:** We are told that 165 marks is equal to 33% of the total.
    -   $0.33 \times \text{Maximum Marks} = 165$
    -   Maximum Marks = $\frac{165}{0.33} = 500$

### **Question 5**

What percentage of numbers from 1 to 70 have squares that end in the digit 1?

1.  20%
2.  10%
3.  14%
4.  21%

**Correct Answer:** 1. 20%

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Identify the Pattern:** A number's square ends in 1 only if the number itself ends in 1 or 9.
2.  **Count the Numbers:**
    -   Numbers ending in 1 (from 1 to 70): 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61 (7 numbers)
    -   Numbers ending in 9 (from 1 to 70): 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69 (7 numbers)
    -   Total numbers = $7 + 7 = 14$
3.  **Calculate Percentage:**
    -   Percentage = $(\frac{\text{Count}}{\text{Total}}) \times 100 = (\frac{14}{70}) \times 100 = \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20\%$

### **Question 6**

A number is increased by 20% and then decreased by 20%. What is the net increase or decrease percentage?

1.  4% decrease
2.  No change
3.  4% increase
4.  2% decrease

**Correct Answer:** 1. 4% decrease

**Solution Explanation:**
Use the successive percentage change formula: $Net\% = x + y + \frac{xy}{100}$
-   Let $x = +20$ (increase) and $y = -20$ (decrease).
-   $Net\% = 20 - 20 + \frac{(20)(-20)}{100} = 0 - \frac{400}{100} = -4\%$
-   The negative sign indicates a 4% decrease.

### **Question 7**

The population of a town was 1,60,000 three years ago. If it increased by 3%, 2.5% and 5% respectively in the last three years, what is the present population?

1.  1,77,366
2.  1,77,000
3.  1,76,366
4.  1,75,366

**Correct Answer:** 1. 1,77,366

**Solution Explanation:**
Calculate the population after each year's increase sequentially.
-   After Year 1: $1,60,000 \times 1.03 = 1,64,800$
-   After Year 2: $1,64,800 \times 1.025 = 1,68,920$
-   After Year 3 (Present): $1,68,920 \times 1.05 = 1,77,366$

### **Question 8**

Two students appeared for an examination. One of them secured 9 marks more than the other and his marks were 56% of the sum of their marks. What are the marks obtained by them?

1.  42, 33
2.  41, 32
3.  43, 34
4.  44, 35

**Correct Answer:** 1. 42, 33

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Set up Variables:** Let the marks of the two students be $x$ and $y$.
    -   $x = y + 9$ (Equation 1)
    -   $x = 0.56 \times (x + y)$ (Equation 2)
2.  **Solve the Equations:** Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2.
    -   $y + 9 = 0.56 \times ((y + 9) + y)$
    -   $y + 9 = 0.56 \times (2y + 9)$
    -   $y + 9 = 1.12y + 5.04$
    -   $9 - 5.04 = 1.12y - y$
    -   $3.96 = 0.12y$
    -   $y = \frac{3.96}{0.12} = 33$
    -   $x = y + 9 = 33 + 9 = 42$
-   The marks are 42 and 33.

### **Question 9**

If 20% of a = b, then b% of 20 is the same as:

1.  4% of a
2.  20% of a
3.  5% of a
4.  10% of a

**Correct Answer:** 1. 4% of a

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **First Equation:** $20\%$ of $a = b \implies 0.20a = b$
2.  **Second Expression:** $b\%$ of $20 = \frac{b}{100} \times 20 = \frac{b}{5}$
3.  **Substitute `b`:** Substitute the value of `b` from the first equation into the second expression.
    -   $\frac{0.20a}{5} = 0.04a$
4.  **Convert to Percentage:** $0.04a$ is equivalent to $4\%$ of $a$.

### **Question 10**

The price of a commodity is increased by 50%. By what fraction must its consumption be reduced so as to keep the same expenditure on its consumption?

1.  1/3
2.  1/2
3.  2/3
4.  3/4

**Correct Answer:** 1. 1/3

**Solution Explanation:**
-   Let the original price be $P$ and consumption be $C$. Expenditure $E = P \times C$.
-   The new price $P'$ is $P \times 1.5 = \frac{3}{2}P$.
-   To keep expenditure the same, the new consumption $C'$ must be multiplied by the reciprocal of the price change factor.
-   $C' = C \times \frac{2}{3}$.
-   The reduction in consumption is $C - C' = C - \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{1}{3}C$.
-   The fraction of reduction is $\frac{1}{3}$.

### **Question 11**

A family spends $240 per month to buy sugar. A rise of 25% in the price of sugar compels the family to reduce the monthly consumption of sugar by 1.5kg as it decides to spend the same amount of money on the purchase of the commodity. What is the increased price per kg of sugar?

**Correct Answer:** $40 per kg

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Calculate the Monetary Impact:** The 25% price rise on the original expenditure of $240 is the amount of money that now pays for the reduced consumption.
    -   Value of reduction = $25\%$ of $240 = 0.25 \times 240 = \$60$
2.  **Find the New Price:** This $60 is the cost of the 1.5 kg of sugar that the family no longer buys, *at the new, increased price*.
    -   Increased Price per kg = $\frac{\text{Value of reduction}}{\text{Quantity of reduction}}$
    -   Increased Price per kg = $\frac{\$60}{1.5 \text{ kg}} = \$40/\text{kg}$

### **Question 12**

In an election between two candidates, Ravi gets 65% of total valid votes. If total votes were 6000, what is the number of valid votes that the other candidate, Sushil gets, if 25% of the total votes were invalid?

**Correct Answer:** 1575 votes

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Calculate Total Valid Votes:** If 25% of votes are invalid, then $100\% - 25\% = 75\%$ are valid.
    -   Total Valid Votes = $75\%$ of $6000 = 0.75 \times 6000 = 4500$
2.  **Calculate Sushil's Percentage:** If Ravi gets 65% of valid votes, Sushil gets the remainder.
    -   Sushil's Share = $100\% - 65\% = 35\%$
3.  **Calculate Sushil's Votes:**
    -   Sushil's Votes = $35\%$ of $4500 = 0.35 \times 4500 = 1575$

### **Question 13**

If the numerator of a fraction is increased by 50% and the denominator is decreased by 28%, the value of the new fraction is 25/36. Find the original fraction.

**Correct Answer:** 98/45

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Set up the equation:** Let the original fraction be $\frac{N}{D}$.
    -   Increasing the numerator by 50% gives $N \times 1.50$.
    -   Decreasing the denominator by 28% gives $D \times (1 - 0.28) = D \times 0.72$.
    -   The new fraction is $\frac{1.50N}{0.72D} = \frac{25}{36}$
2.  **Solve for N/D:**
    -   $\frac{N}{D} \times \frac{1.50}{0.72} = \frac{25}{36}$
    -   $\frac{N}{D} = \frac{25}{36} \times \frac{0.72}{1.50}$
    -   $\frac{N}{D} = \frac{25}{36} \times \frac{72}{150}$
    -   Simplify: $\frac{N}{D} = \frac{25}{150} \times \frac{72}{36} = \frac{1}{6} \times 2 = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$
    -   Wait, let's re-calculate:
    -   $\frac{N}{D} = \frac{25}{36} \times \frac{72}{150}$
    -   $\frac{N}{D} = \frac{25 \times 2}{150} = \frac{50}{150} = \frac{1}{3}$
    -   **Let me re-read the original question and solution. My calculation seems to be different from the stored answer.**
    -   Let's check the stored answer: if the original is 98/45.
        -   New Numerator: $98 \times 1.5 = 147$.
        -   New Denominator: $45 \times 0.72 = 32.4$.
        -   New Fraction: $147 / 32.4 = 1470 / 324$. This doesn't seem to simplify to 25/36 easily.
    -   There must be an error in my previous reasoning for Question 13. Let me re-solve from scratch.
        -   New Numerator = $N \times (1 + 50/100) = 1.5N$
        -   New Denominator = $D \times (1 - 28/100) = 0.72D$
        -   $\frac{1.5N}{0.72D} = \frac{25}{36}$
        -   $\frac{N}{D} = \frac{25}{36} \times \frac{0.72}{1.5} = \frac{25}{36} \times \frac{72}{150}$
        -   $\frac{N}{D} = \frac{25 \times 2}{150} = \frac{50}{150} = \frac{1}{3}$.
    -   **It appears my initial solution for this question was incorrect.** The correct answer is 1/3. I will correct the provided answer.

**Correct Answer:** 1/3

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Set up the equation:** Let the original fraction be $\frac{N}{D}$.
    -   The new numerator is $N \times (1 + 0.50) = 1.5N$.
    -   The new denominator is $D \times (1 - 0.28) = 0.72D$.
    -   The new fraction is given as $\frac{1.5N}{0.72D} = \frac{25}{36}$.
2.  **Isolate the original fraction (N/D):**
    -   $\frac{N}{D} = \frac{25}{36} \times \frac{0.72}{1.5}$
3.  **Solve the expression:**
    -   $\frac{N}{D} = \frac{25}{36} \times \frac{72}{150}$
    -   You can simplify $\frac{72}{36} = 2$ and $\frac{25}{150} = \frac{1}{6}$.
    -   $\frac{N}{D} = 2 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$.
-   The original fraction is 1/3.

### **Question 14**

If the price of a commodity is increased by 50%, by what fraction must its consumption be reduced so as to keep the same expenditure on its consumption?

**Correct Answer:** 1/3

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Relationship:** Expenditure = Price $\times$ Consumption.
2.  **Price Change:** The price is multiplied by a factor of 1.5 (or $\frac{3}{2}$).
3.  **Consumption Change:** To keep the expenditure constant, consumption must be multiplied by the reciprocal of the price factor. The reciprocal of $\frac{3}{2}$ is $\frac{2}{3}$.
4.  **Calculate Reduction:** If the new consumption is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the original, the reduction is the remaining part.
    -   Reduction = $1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}$.

### **Question 15**

70% of students in a class are girls and 70% of the girls have chosen soccer as their favourite sport. If 98 girls have chosen soccer as their favourite sport, what is the total number of students in the class?

**Correct Answer:** 200

**Solution Explanation:**
1.  **Set up the equation:** Let T be the total number of students.
    -   Number of girls = $70\%$ of $T = 0.70T$.
    -   Girls who like soccer = $70\%$ of (Number of girls) = $0.70 \times (0.70T)$.
2.  **Solve for T:** We are given that 98 girls like soccer.
    -   $98 = 0.70 \times 0.70 \times T$
    -   $98 = 0.49T$
    -   $T = \frac{98}{0.49} = \frac{9800}{49} = 200$.
-   There are 200 students in the class.
